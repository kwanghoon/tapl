Exercises


5.1 Basics


(Core calculus and dervied forms)

 - Explain briefly what is a core caclulus and what are derived forms?

 [SOLUTION]




(The syntax of lambda calculus)

 - Write the syntax of the lambda calculus:

 [SOLUTION]




 - What is variable in the syntax in the syntax?

[SOLUTION]


 - What is abstraction in the syntax?

[SOLUTION]


 - What is application in the syntax?
 
 [SOLUTION]



 - If you write 1 + 2 + 3, it means (1 + 2) + 3.
   You don't have to write the parenthesis.

   The plus operation (+) is said to be left-associative
   because the parentheses may be omitted. 

   For 's t u', it is the same as '(s t) u'.
   If you want to write s (t u), you should not
   omit the parenthesis.

   So, the lambda application (operation) is

    (1) left associative
    (2) right associative

   ?
 [SOLUTION]



 - Explain briefly the difference between meta variables
   and (object) variables in the lambda calculus.

 [SOLUTION]


(The semantics of lambda calculus)


 - Explain briefly the difference between free variables
   and bound variables

 [SOLUTION]



 - Explain briefly a single step evaluation ---> on
   lambda terms. 

 [SOLUTION]



 - Refer to Page 22 for the definition of FV(t), a set of
   free variables occurring in the term t. 

  Explain briefly the defition of FV(t) for variable, abstraction, and
  application terms. .

 [SOLUTION]






 - Refer to Page 23 for the definition of substitutions
   [x |->s ] t.

  Explain briefly what is [x |-> s]t. 

 [SOLUTION]






5.2 Programming in the lambda calculus

 - Explain how a lambda calculus handles more than two arguments by
   writing an add function under the assumption that (+) and the
   reduction n + m are available.

   [Hint: Slide P.11]

 [SOLUTION]




 - Explain how to encode boolean values(true and false) and a test function
   with a property as
   
      (1) test tru m n -> ... -> m
      (2) test fls m n -> ... -> n

   for some terms m and n. 

   [Hint: Slide P.12]
   
 [SOLUTION]

   tru = 


   fls = 


   test = 


 - Verify the propery using your solution.

 [SOLUTION]
 
     (1) test tru m n -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> m


     (2) test tru m n -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> n


 - The logical conjunction (and) is defined as

        and = λb. λ c. b c fls

   Verify the defintion of and if it does the logical conjunction by showing:


 [SOLUTION]
 
     (1) and tru tru -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> tru


     (2) and tru fls -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> fls


     (3) and fls tru -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> fls


     (4) and fls fls -> [ fill in the reduction process here ] -> fls


 - Define the logical or and the logical not functions. How do you
   know that they works well?

 [SOLUTION]
 
    or =

    not =


    
 - Define the functions pair (to create a pair), fst (to select the
   first element of a pair), and snd (to select the second element of
   a pair)

 [SOLUTION]
 
    pair =


    fst =


    snd =



 - Using the solution for pair, fst, and snd, evaluate the following
   terms.

 [SOLUTION]
 
   fst ( pair v w ) ->


   snd ( pair v w ) ->


   for some terms v and w. 


 - Under the definition of the church numerals as

    c₀ = λs.λz.z
    c₁ = λs.λz.s z
    c₂ = λs.λz.s² z
    ⋯
    cₙ = λs.λz.sⁿ z
    ⋯

   denoting the numbers, zero, one, two, ..., n.


   Given a function addone

    addone = λn. λs. λz. s (n s z)

   Evaluate the following term:
   
 [SOLUTION]

    addone c¹ →


 - Under the definition of the church numerals above,
   plus and times are defined as follows.
    

    (1) plus = λm. λn. λs. λz. m s (n s z)

    (2) times = λm. λn. m (plus n) c₀


   Evaluate the following temrs.

 [SOLUTION]

   plus c₂ c₁ →


   times c₂ c₁ →
